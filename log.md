**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

### Day 1: February 21, 2017 
**Today's Progress**: Worked on the FCC Basic Algoritm Confirm the Ending 

**Thoughts:** I used the .slice(-1)[0] method, which i used to returned the  value of the last index however, that didn't work becuase i needed to return same in sesame which return false because i was returning sesame.

slice() didn't quite work so i went with the suggested methood of substring()
