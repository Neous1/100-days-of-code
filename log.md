##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

### Day 1: February 21, 2017 
**Today's Progress**: Worked on the FCC Basic Algoritm Confirm the Ending 

**Thoughts:** I used the .slice(-1)[0] method, which i used to returned the  value of the last index however, that didn't work becuase i needed to return same in sesame which return false because i was returning sesame.

slice() didn't quite work so i went with the suggested methood of substring()

### Day 2: February 22, 2017 
**Today's Progress**: completed the FCC Basic Algoritm Truncate a string 

**Thoughts:** I was only able to complete this challenge by mmoving the str.len > num && num <= 3 to the top of the if ... else chain in order for all the conditions to be met
